/*
A friend function is able to access private data members without the need of inheriting the class.
The friend function acts as a bridge between two classes by accessing their private data.
It can be declared either in the public or private or protected part of the class.
Friendship is not mutual. If class A is a friend of B, then B doesnâ€™t become a friend of A automatically.
Friendship is not inherited.
