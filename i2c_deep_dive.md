I2C Deep Dive: Everything You Need to Know
## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Basics of I2C
## What is I2C?

Inter-Integrated Circuit (I2C) is a multi-master, multi-slave serial communication protocol.
Uses only 2 lines:
- SCL (Clock)
- SDA (Data)
Supports synchronous communication.

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Addressing in I2C
Why 7-bit Addressing?
- 7-bit address (2‚Å∑ = 128 addresses)
- The 8th bit is the R/W bit.
- The actual usable address range: 0x08 - 0x77 (112 devices) since some addresses are reserved.
# Why 10-bit Addressing?
Expands the address space to 1024 devices.
Uses a prefix (11110xxx) for 10-bit mode.
Rarely used because most I2C peripherals support only 7-bit addressing.

## Tricky Interview Questions
‚úÖ Q: Why does I2C use 7-bit addressing instead of 8-bit?

üìå A: The 8th bit is reserved for Read/Write direction. The address must be sent in 7 bits, and the R/W bit tells whether the master is reading or writing.

‚úÖ Q: How do you calculate the write and read address for a device with a 7-bit address?

üìå A:
Left shift the address by 1.
- Write Address = (7-bit address << 1) | 0
- Read Address = (7-bit address << 1) | 1

Example: For 0x50 (7-bit address),
- Write operation: 0xA0
- Read operation: 0xA1


## 3Ô∏è‚É£ I2C Communication Process
üîπ Start & Stop Conditions
Start (S): SDA transitions from HIGH to LOW while SCL is HIGH.
Stop (P): SDA transitions from LOW to HIGH while SCL is HIGH.
``` c
// Generate Start condition
SDA = 0;  // Pull SDA LOW
SCL = 1;  // Keep SCL HIGH
```

### üîπ Data Transmission
Master sends 8-bit data (MSB first).
Slave ACKs (pulls SDA LOW) or NACKs (leaves SDA HIGH).
9 clock pulses per byte (8 bits + 1 ACK/NACK).

### üîπ Clock Stretching
If a slave needs more time, it holds SCL LOW (Clock stretching).
The master must wait for SCL to be released before continuing.
```c
while (SCL == 0);  // Wait for slave to release clock
```

‚úÖ Q: What happens if the slave does not respond to the master?

üìå A: The master receives a NACK and can either:
Retry communication.
Generate a STOP condition.
Implement bus recovery (explained below).

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ I2C Error Handling & Bus Recovery
üîπ Common I2C Issues
Issue	Cause	Solution
Bus Hang (SDA stuck LOW)	Slave crashed during transmission	Send 9 clock pulses, then STOP
No ACK from Slave	Wrong address, device not connected	Check address, wiring, power
Clock Stretching Hang	Slave holds SCL LOW forever	Timeout and reset slave
üîπ I2C Bus Recovery (9 Clock Pulses)
```c 
void I2C_Bus_Recovery() {
    for (int i = 0; i < 9; i++) {
        SCL = 1;
        delayMicroseconds(5);
        SCL = 0;
        delayMicroseconds(5);
    }
    // Send STOP condition
    SDA = 1;
    SCL = 1;
}
```

‚úÖ Q: Why do we send 9 clock pulses for I2C bus recovery?

üìå A: A full I2C frame consists of 8 bits + 1 ACK/NACK. Sending 9 clocks flushes any stuck data and forces the slave to release SDA.

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ Hidden I2C Concepts & Edge Cases
üîπ Multi-Master Arbitration
If two masters transmit at the same time, arbitration happens:
The master sending LOW while the other sends HIGH wins.
The losing master stops communication.

‚úÖ Q: How does I2C resolve bus conflicts when multiple masters send data?

üìå A: The master monitors SDA while sending data:

If it detects another master‚Äôs LOW while sending HIGH, it stops.
üîπ Clock Synchronization (Multi-Master)
If multiple masters send data, the slowest master determines the clock speed.
Masters only release SCL when they are ready.

‚úÖ Q: What happens if two I2C masters operate at different speeds?

üìå A: The slower master controls the clock, because SCL must be high for all masters before data transmission continues.

6Ô∏è‚É£ I2C Interview Cheat Sheet
üîπ Tricky I2C Interview Questions

‚úÖ Q: What is the maximum number of devices in an I2C network?

üìå A:
7-bit addressing: 112 devices (after excluding reserved addresses).
10-bit addressing: 1024 devices.

‚úÖ Q: How does the I2C master detect a missing slave?

üìå A: The slave does not send ACK after receiving an address.

‚úÖ Q: How does I2C detect errors?

üìå A:
ACK/NACK mechanism: If a slave fails to acknowledge, the master knows there‚Äôs a problem.
Bus timeout: Some microcontrollers can reset I2C after a timeout.

‚úÖ Q: How do you handle multiple I2C devices with the same address?

üìå A:

Use an I2C multiplexer (e.g., TCA9548A).
Check if the device has configurable address pins (e.g., A0, A1).
Use a software I2C implementation on different GPIOs.

‚úÖ Q: What happens if an I2C slave stretches the clock forever?

üìå A:
The bus hangs!
The master can set a timeout or reset the slave using GPIO control.
