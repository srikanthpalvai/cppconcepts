/*Inheritance
Inheritance is one of four pillars of Object-Oriented Programming (OOPs)
It is a feature that enables a class to acquire properties and characteristics of another class. 
Inheritance allows you to reuse your code since the derived class or the child class can reuse the members of the base class by inheriting them.
A child inherits some properties from his/her parents, such as the ability to speak, walk, eat, and so on

Types of Inheritances in c++
1. Single inheritance
2. Multiple  inheritance
3. Multilevelinheritance
4. Hierarchical  inheritance
5. Hybrid  inheritance
